# Taxi Fare Prediction – Regression Model

This project involves building a regression model to predict taxi trip fares using real-world data. The dataset includes variables like trip distance, passenger count, and timestamps, which are cleaned, scaled, and transformed to create meaningful input features.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Load and preprocess real-world taxi trip data
- Apply feature engineering (e.g., datetime parsing, distance calculations)
- Normalize and scale input features
- Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- Visualize prediction accuracy and residuals

## 🧪 Educational Use

This project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning regression in real-world transport and logistics systems. Suitable for CS projects focusing on predictive modeling and applied data science.

## 📁 Dataset

A cleaned and processed dataset including features such as:
- Pickup and dropoff datetime
- Passenger count
- Trip distance
- Fare amount (target variable)
